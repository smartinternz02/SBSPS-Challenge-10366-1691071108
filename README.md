# Autonomous-Tagging-Of-Stack-Overflow-Questions

**1. INTRODUCTION**

a. Overview

This prototype is designed to automate the process of tagging of Stack Overflow
questions. Presently, a human interference is required to assign tags to the questions
posted on the Website. This turns out to be a cumbersome process and takes a lot of time
to tag each and every questions and categorize the same.

b. Purpose

This prototype is developed to automate the process of tagging and categorization of
Stack Overflow questions. Hence, incorporates machine learning model to do the job of
tagging and categorization. This increases the efficiency of work and accurately assign
tags at the time of posting the question into the website.

**2. LITERATURE SURVEY**

2.1) Existing Problem

In the existing scenario, a human intelligence is required to deal with tagging and
categorization of Stack Overflow questions which may lead to certain human errors and it
is an ineffective process of carrying out this issue. Here, one needs to read each and every
question and assign tags to the same. This may be inaccurate at times.

2.2) Proposed Solution

Based on the above issue, we have proposed a solution where a Web application
incorporated with well-trained model helps in analyzing the ingested question and predict
the suitable tag for the same. This provides relevant tags for the question job of tagging
and categorization. This increases the efficiency of work and accurately assign tags at the
time of posting the question into the website. It reduces the time taken to tag and
categorize the questions in Stack Overflow.

**Technology Stack**

● IBM Cloud Pak
● IBM Watson Studio
● IBM Jupyter notebook
● Visual Studio Code
● Python version-3.11.4
● Google Colab

**3. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS**

a. This method can be used by different web portals where people post different questions
(e.g., Reddit, Quora, etc..). This enhances the time consumed in tagging and categorizing
the questions posted.

b. Model can be trained on timely basis using IBM watsonx for better usage and prediction
capability.

c. It also provides accurate tags for the questions posted.

**5.RESULT**

The objective of this solution is to create a website or GUI which is integrated with well
trained model provides the following capabilities.

● This model accurately predicts the questions posted in it.

● A simple interface which can be directly incorporated in the website

● So, this is how we built our Autonomous Tagging of Stack Overflow questions using
machine learning.
